    <h2>Elect Angel Organization</h2>

        <li>
            Introduction
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The conclusion of the prehistoric angelic conflict in heaven yielded two opposing forces: those angelic creatures who were elect (who chose for God) and those who were fallen (who chose against God and followed the fallen). The true size of these angelic armies is indeterminable but likely in the hundreds of millions. Of the elect angels, one-third of the total angelic force, God said thousands upon thousands (Ps. 68:17a); and in Gethsemane Jesus said, “Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?” (Matt. 26:53). The Apostle John “heard the voice of many angels around the throne … and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands” (Rev. 5:11).</li>
                <li>These myriads of elect angels in the heavenly protocol are a well-defined organization. Created to glorify God, they perform various duties in heaven and on Earth, heralding and executing His plans. They are involved in the creation, prophecy, declarations and judgments, battling the demonic hordes as combatants in God’s heavenly army, and ministering to believers on Earth.</li>

            Ranks and Description
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Seraphim (שְׂרָפִים seraphim) are the super-royal/seraphic elect angels. “Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew” (Isa. 6:2). “Seraph” means “burning ones.” They are described in Isaiah 6:2, “Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.” Seraphim are specifically associated with the throne of God in Isaiah 6.</li>
                <li>Cherubim (כְּרוּבִים kerubim): the royal elect angels. God has “made them ride on a cherub and fly; and He sped upon the wings of the wind” (Ps. 18:10). Cherubim guard the throne of God, the garden of Eden, and the ark of the covenant. They are commanded by Jesus Christ, “the Lord of hosts” (Ps. 46:7), and composed of three descending ranks: the six-winged seraphim, who lead in worship and humility in God’s holiness; the four-winged cherubim, who guard God’s holiness; and the wingless elect angels, who serve as messengers, guardians, and soldiers.</li>
                <li>There is much we do not know about elect angels. God has not revealed many of their functions and hierarchy primarily in the Books of Daniel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Luke, and Revelation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Seraphim have two roles:
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>As leaders of heavenly worship, to glorify God.</li>
                <li>As angelic heralds, to function as messengers between God and man.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Highest Ranking Seraphim—Archangels
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Comparable to four-star generals, archangels perform the most critical and distinguished duties with regard to divine revelation and judgment.

                                <li>The title of archangel is specifically used with Michael in Jude 9 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16 with the devil and Michael contending over Moses’ body.</li>
                                <li>Michael commands the army of angels who defend Israel.</li>

            Of the twenty-four elders (angels?) seated on twenty-four thrones surrounding the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rev. 4:4).
