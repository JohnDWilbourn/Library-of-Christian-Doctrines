    <h2>Doctrine of the Fifth Part</h2>
    <ol class="roman">
        <li>Man gains through grace: This applies to the believer who is wronged and puts the matter in the Lord’s hands. Such a believer becomes the gainer. “never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” (Rom. 12:19).</li>
        <li>Man gains more by salvation than he lost in the Fall: In his Fall, man was lower than angels, but through salvation, with God’s righteousness, he became positionally higher than the angels (Heb. 1:14).</li>
        <li>Application: Man also gains by the cross. “How will He [God the Father] not also with Him [Jesus Christ] freely [graciously] give us [believers] all things?” (Rom. 8:32b).</li>
        <li>Illustration: When wronged through sins of the tongue, the believer becomes the gainer when he leaves judgment to God (Matt. 7:2).</li>
        <li>Gain through rebound: The believer who rebounds gains blessing. Even if his suffering continues, the cursing of discipline is turned to blessing (Rom. 8:35–37).</li>
        <li>Cursing turned to blessing: The added one-fifth in the rebound offering denotes the replacement of cursing with blessing. On the cross, Jesus Christ removed our curse and substituted blessing (Rom. 8:31).</li>
        <li>Conclusion
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The believer who understands grace is not disturbed by the instabilities of mankind.</li>
                <li>The believer who lives by grace always gains, even though he appears to be losing (Rom. 8:35).</li>
                <li>Grace cannot lose in sin, adversity, suffering, or prosperity.
                    <ol class="decimal">
                        <li>Grace in phase one: salvation (Ps. 103:8–12; Rom. 3:23–24; 4:4; 5:20; 2 Cor. 8:9; Eph. 2:8–9; Titus 2:11; 3:7; Heb. 2:9)</li>
                        <li>Grace in phase two: the spiritual life, provision, and sustenance (1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 6:1; 12:9; 2 Tim. 2:1; 1 Pet. 5:12; 2 Pet. 3:18); greater grace to the spiritually mature (Heb. 12:28; James 4:6)</li>
                        <li>Grace in phase three: eternity (Eph. 2:7)</li>
