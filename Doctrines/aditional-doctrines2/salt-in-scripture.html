    <h2>Doctrine of Salt in Scripture</h2>
    <ol class="roman">
        <li>Salt is a preserver. The Phoenicians imported fish and other goods to Judah (Neh. 13:16), and salt was used in curing and drying the fish. Salt kept foods from spoiling; therefore, salt speaks of eternal life. The gift offering together with the salt reminds us of John 3:16.
            <p>To those in the Church Age who have believed in God’s indescribable Gift, salt encompasses positional truth. One of the many assets which God gives to us at the moment of salvation is the baptism of the Spirit, whereby believers are entered into union with Christ, who is eternal life.<sup>57</sup> We now share His life (1 John 5:11–12), and “neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 8:38b–39). We are thus “salted,” preserved forever!</p>
        </li>
        <li>Salt is a seasoner (Job 6:6). As a seasoning, salt is figurative of the believer’s inner happiness response to the gift of eternal life, namely, the joy of salvation which comes from a knowledge of Bible doctrine. Salt, then, is doctrine, which seasons life (Col. 4:6). As salt makes foods palatable and tasty, so Bible doctrine makes life more flavorful because knowledge of God’s truth gives the capacity for its enjoyment to the fullest.</li>
        <li>Salt by analogy is the antithesis of leaven. Salt is a preserver—true doctrine; leaven is a corrupter—false doctrine (1 Cor. 5:8; Gal. 5:9).</li>
        <li>Customs of the ancient world used salt to signify a contract or hospitality.
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Under the laws of hospitality: If, as an enemy of the host, you ate salt with him at the table, you were preserved from harm while in his house.</li>
                <li>As a sign of fulfilling a contract: Both parties in the contract ate salt as a symbol of agreement and abiding friendship.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The eating of salt depicts the appropriation of salvation. The moment you “ate the salt” of eternal life you were saved. After salvation, the eating of salt pictures the learning of Bible doctrine.</li>
        <li>“Salted with fire” refers to eternity spent in the lake of fire (Mark 9:48–49). Since the unbeliever has no salt in him, he is disqualified from eternity with God.</li>
        <li>Believers are said to be the “salt of the earth” (Matt. 5:13).
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Salt acts as an unseen preservative. The presence of doctrinally oriented believers in a society or nation is the basis for its preservation (Mark 9:50).</li>
                <li>Salt provides flavor. This is the believer’s impact on society by his application of Bible doctrine and his communication of the divine viewpoint of life (Col. 4:6).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The “salt has become tasteless” is analogous to the believer perpetually out of fellowship and in reversionism (Matt. 5:13; Luke 14:34–35).</li>
        <li>Inferior salt was used as a fertilizer in the ancient world and as a means to speed the decomposition of dung (Matt. 5:13; cf. Luke 14:34–35).</li>
        <li>The strewing of salt over the ruins of a captured city was a sign of utter desolation and irretrievable ruin (Judg. 9:45), as with Sodom and Gomorrah (Deut. 29:23; Zeph. 2:9) and as the Romans reportedly did to celebrate their victory at Carthage in 146 B.C.</li>
        <li>Newborn babies of the ancient world were bathed and then rubbed with salt (Ezek. 16:4).</li>
        <li>Salt was used as a purifier (2 Kings 2:21).</li>
        <li>The “salt of the covenant of your God” (Lev. 2:13).
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>This phrase refers to an ancient custom whereby treaties or agreements were ratified by a covenant of salt. Both parties ate salt out of a common dish as a symbol of mutual agreement and abiding friendship. This made the contract valid and binding, equivalent to cosignatures on a legal transaction (Num. 18:19).</li>
                <li>The “salt of the covenant of your God” is the subject of the study of the Levitical offerings (Lev. 2:13), and applies to a contract God has provided for us, the cross. This contract is based upon the Father’s propitiation and man’s reconciliation. Propitiation: God, the Party of the first part, eats the salt. Reconciliation: Man, the party of the second part, eats the salt. Were it not for the cross, God and man would be at enmity with each other forever (Rom. 5), but thanks to the cross, the contract contains an eternal life clause, although a conditional one. It states that if any member of the human race will believe in Christ, he will be given eternal life (Rom. 5:8–10). God and man can “eat the salt” of this covenant and consequently come together in an eternal and abiding relationship. The offer is still open today; you can accept it or reject it.</li>
