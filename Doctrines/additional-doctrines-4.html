    <h2>The Doctrine of the Devil's Seven</h2>
    <ol class="roman">
        <li>
            The person of the devil.
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The devil is the highest of all angelic creatures and the ruler of fallen angels (Matt. 9:34; 12:26; Luke 11:18–19).</li>
                <li>The devil was created by God before the creation of the human race (Ps. 148:5b; Col. 1:16).</li>
                <li>The devil has three falls (Isa. 14; Ezek. 28; Rev. 12, 20).</li>
                <li>The devil has two advents (Gen. 3; Rev. 20).</li>
                <li>The devil is the central antagonist of the angelic conflict (Gen. 6; 1 Pet. 3:18–22; 5:8; Rev. 12:4).</li>
                <li>The devil has an organization (Eph. 6:12).</li>
                <li>The devil is a murderer (John 8:44).</li>
                <li>The devil is the opponent to Bible doctrine (Matt. 13:19, 39).</li>
                <li>The devil is the enemy of Church Age believers (1 Tim. 3:7; Rev. 2:9, 13, 24).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            The rulership of the devil (Luke 4:5–7; John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11; 2 Cor. 4:4; Eph. 2:2).
        </li>
        <li>
            The devil’s strategy regarding the nations of the world:
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>He deceives (Rev. 12:9; 20:3, 20:8).</li>
                <li>He is the chief opponent to the laws of divine establishment, the sovereignty and freedom of nationalism.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            The devil’s strategy regarding unbelievers.
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Runs the gamut from blinding their minds to the Gospel to all forms of sin and degeneracy (Luke 8:12; 2 Cor. 4:3–4; 2 Thess. 2:7–10; 2 Pet. 2; Rev. 17).</li>
                <li>Religion is the devil’s ace trump, promoting human works instead of God’s grace.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Strategy regarding the believer (2 Cor. 2:11).
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>To accuse the believer (Job 1:6–11; Zech. 3:1–2; Rev. 12:9–10).</li>
                <li>To sponsor reversionism (1 Cor. 10:19–21; 2 Cor. 11:3, 13–15; Eph. 4:27).</li>
                <li>To frustrate the will of God.
                    <ol class="decimal">
                        <li>Viewpoint will (Eph. 4:14).</li>
                        <li>Geographical will (1 Thess. 2:18).</li>
                        <li>Operational will (James 4:7–8).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>To neutralize doctrinal application through worry and other mental attitude sins (1 Pet. 5:7–9).</li>
                <li>To destroy the believer’s focus on Christ and Bible doctrine.
                    <ol class="decimal">
                        <li>Eyes on people (Jer. 17:5).</li>
                        <li>Eyes on self (1 Kings 19:10–14).</li>
                        <li>Eyes on things (Heb. 13:5–6).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>To get the believer to become involved in the improvement of the devil’s world. Hence, the reversionistic believer becomes humanistic, occupied with temporal solutions to man’s problems, advocating systems to improve man’s environment, such as socialism, Christian activism, the social gospel.</li>
                <li>To inculcate fear regarding physical death (Heb. 2:14–15).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Religion is part of the devil’s strategy to counterfeit the plan of God. Christianity is not a religion, but a relationship with God through faith alone in Christ alone. Religion, by way of contrast, is man seeking the approbation of God through his own plans, works, merits, and systems. Religion represents the evil genius of Satan, and it is viewed here from the standpoint of its many counterfeits.
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Counterfeit gospel (2 Cor. 4:3–4).</li>
                <li>Counterfeit ministers (Acts 13:6–10; 2 Cor. 11:13–15).</li>
                <li>Counterfeit doctrine (Eph. 5:6; 1 Tim. 4:1).</li>
                <li>Counterfeit communion table (Luke 4:3; 1 Cor. 10:19–21).</li>
                <li>Counterfeit spirituality (1 Cor. 3:18; Gal. 3:2–3).</li>
                <li>Counterfeit righteousness (Matt. 19:16–28).</li>
                <li>Counterfeit modus vivendi (Matt. 23:13–36).</li>
                <li>Counterfeit power and dynamics (2 Thess. 2:8–10).</li>
                <li>Counterfeit gods (2 Thess. 2:3–4).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            False teachers as part of the devil’s strategy:
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>False teachers have a phony and hypocritical facade (Matt. 7:15; Rom. 16:18).</li>
                <li>False teachers use human public relations systems and legalistic flirtation to court believers (2 Tim. 3:5–7).</li>
                <li>False teachers appeal to human ego and pride (2 Cor. 10:12).</li>
                <li>False teachers promote idolatry as part of the devil’s communion table (Hab. 2:18–19).</li>
                <li>False teachers promote legalism and self-righteousness (1 Tim. 1:7–8).</li>
                <li>False teachers continue to operate throughout this intensified period of the angelic conflict (1 John 4:1).</li>

    <h2>Categorical Doctrine of Prayer</h2>
    <ol class="roman">
        <li>
            The approach to prayer
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Addressed to the Father (Matt. 6:9; Eph. 3:14; 5:20)</li>
                <li>In the name of the Son (John 14:13–14; 16:23–24; Eph. 5:20)</li>
                <li>In the power of the Spirit (Eph. 6:18)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Three categories of prayer directed to God the Father
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>From the source of the Son (Heb. 7:25)</li>
                <li>From the source of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:26–27)</li>
                <li>From the source of the believer-priest (Heb. 4:16)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            The agenda for private prayer
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Confession (1 John 1:9)</li>
                <li>Thanksgiving (Eph. 5:20; 1 Thess. 5:18)</li>
                <li>Intercession (Eph. 6:18)</li>
                <li>Petition (Heb. 4:16)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Prayer requires the application of faith-rest: “believing, you will receive” (Matt. 21:22; Mark 11:24).
        </li>
        <li>
            Eight principles of prayer
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Prayer is the most effective when the believer learns Bible doctrine and advances to spiritual maturity (John 15:7).</li>
                <li>Prayer is an application of the faith-rest drill (Matt. 21:22; Mark 11:24).</li>
                <li>Prayer demands cognizance of the will of God, therefore the necessity of maximum knowledge of Bible doctrine (1 John 5:14).</li>
                <li>Prayer must be offered in status of the filling of the Spirit (Eph. 6:18).</li>
                <li>When the believer is carnal, prayer is ineffective (Ps. 66:18).</li>
                <li>Prayer must comply with the principle of grace (Heb. 4:16).</li>
                <li>Prayer is part of the divine decree (Jer. 33:3).</li>
                <li>Prayer is related to personal love toward God (Ps. 116:1–2).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Nine reasons why prayer is not answered (Note: all are connected with carnality)
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Not filled with the Spirit (Eph. 6:18)</li>
                <li>No faith-rest function (Matt. 21:22)</li>
                <li>Mental attitude carnality (Ps. 66:18)</li>
                <li>Lust-type selfishness (James 4:2–4)</li>
                <li>Lack of obedience (1 John 3:22)</li>
                <li>Noncompliance with specific and known will of God (1 John 5:14)</li>
                <li>Pride as a basic mental attitude sin (Job 35:12–13)</li>
                <li>Lack of compassion or grace orientation (Prov. 21:13)</li>
                <li>Lack of domestic tranquility (1 Pet. 3:7)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Principle of grace in prayer (Heb. 4:16)
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Prayer is a privilege and extension of grace; hence, it is impossible to approach God in prayer on the basis of human good or human merit.</li>
                <li>The believer approaches God in prayer on the basis of our High Priest, Jesus Christ, and His merits.</li>
                <li>The Father is propitiated by the work of Christ; we must, therefore, approach in prayer through Christ and from a position of fellowship with God.</li>
                <li>God does not answer prayers because a person is fervent, moral, sincere, religious, or self-effacing.</li>
                <li>God answers prayer because of who and what He is.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            The categories of petition in prayer
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Positive—Negative: Petition answered; desire not answered (1 Sam. 8:5–9, 19–20)</li>
                <li>Negative—Positive: Petition not answered; desire answered (Gen. 17:18–21; 18:23–33; 2 Cor. 12:7–10)</li>
                <li>Positive—Positive: Petition answered; desire answered (Judg. 16:28; 1 Kings 18:36–39; Luke 23:42–43; John 11:41–45)</li>
                <li>Negative—Negative: Neither petition nor desire answered (2 Cor. 12:7–8)</li>

    <h2>Doctrine of the Royal Family of God</h2>
    <ol class="roman">
        <li>
            Definition
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>As the manifest person of the Trinity, our Lord wears the crown of divine royalty. His first royal title is “Son of God.” The members of His royal family are God the Father and God the Holy Spirit with whom He has eternal and infinite coexistence.</li>
                <li>Jesus Christ is descended from the lines of two of the sons of David by Bathsheba. The line of royal descent from Solomon, listed in Matthew, ends with Joseph (not the real father of our Lord). The line of royal descent from Nathan, given in Luke, comes down to Mary, our Lord’s real mother. Jesus is, therefore, Jewish royalty. His second royal title is “Son of David,” and His royal family is the dynasty of David.</li>
                <li>As a result of our Lord’s strategic victory on the cross and His resurrection, ascension, and session, He received His third royal patent: “King of kings and Lord of lords” and “the bright morning star” (1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 19:16; 22:16).</li>
                <li>When our Lord received His third royal patent, He had no royal family to accompany the title. A third royal family therefore had to be formed. God the Father interrupted the dispensation of Israel and inserted the Church Age for the calling out (formation, election) of a royal family to accompany Christ’s third royal title. All believers of the Church Age are the royal family of the King of kings and Lord of lords, Jesus Christ (Rev. 1:6).</li>
                <li>While regeneration has occurred in every dispensation since the beginning of time, it is only the regenerate of the Church Age who form this royal family.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            The nomenclature for the royal family of God
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>“Church” emphasizes the function of the royal family of God during the present dispensation (1 Cor. 11:18; 14:19, 34–35; Phil. 4:15; 1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1; Rev. 2–3).</li>
                <li>“Body of Christ” emphasizes the utilization of the same divine power and Bible doctrine used to sustain the humanity of Christ in hypostatic union (Rom. 7:4; Eph. 4:12).</li>
                <li>“Bride of Christ” emphasizes the royal family of God after resurrection (Rev. 19:7; 21:9).</li>
                <li>“Temple” emphasizes the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Basis of royalty in the Church Age
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The mechanics for the formation of this royal family is the baptism of the Spirit, which places the believer in union with Christ. By being entered into union with Christ, all believers of the Church Age are adopted as royal family of God (Acts 1:5; Rom. 6:3–4; Gal. 3:26–28).</li>
                <li>In every dispensation the believer is regenerated by the Holy Spirit at the moment he believes in Christ, but in the Church Age at the moment he believes the Holy Spirit also baptizes him into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13).</li>
                <li>No believer before or after the Church Age receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The baptism is unique to this dispensation (Col. 1:25–26).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Precedent for royalty
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The order of Melchizedek provides both the pattern and precedent (Heb. 5:6–10).</li>
                <li>Melchizedek acquired his royalty in becoming king of Salem, while Jesus Christ was born royalty in the line of David (Matt. 1).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Relationship to the King
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>As a member of the Body of Christ, every believer of the Church Age is eternally and personally related to the King of kings (Gal. 3:26–29).</li>
                <li>Christ is the absolute ruler of the Church (Eph. 5:24a; Col. 1:18).</li>
                <li>When the Body of Christ is completed, the Church Age terminates with resurrection or the Rapture at which time the Body of Christ becomes the Bride of Christ (Matt. 25:1–13; 1 Thess. 4:16–18).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Sign of royalty
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The sign of royalty is the unprecedented, universal indwelling of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19–20).</li>
                <li>The Holy Spirit indwells the body of the Church Age believer to provide a temple for the indwelling of Christ.</li>
                <li>Church Age believers are indwelt forever and are therefore royalty forever.</li>
                <li>The purpose of this indwelling is to glorify Jesus Christ (John 7:37–39).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Security of royalty
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The sealing ministry of the Holy Spirit guarantees the eternal security of the Church Age believer (Eph. 1:13–14).</li>
                <li>Positional sanctification qualifies every Church Age believer to live in heaven forever (Eph. 1:3–4, 11).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Function of royalty
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>All Church Age believers are in full time royal service for Christ as royal priests and royal ambassadors.</li>
                <li>The believer fulfills the status of royalty in the modus operandi of the new priesthood (Heb. 7—13).</li>
                <li>The believer must advance toward the objective of supergrace, at which time he receives the accouterments of royalty as well as the tactical victory of the angelic conflict.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Future of royalty
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>At the Rapture of the Church, the royal family is transferred to heaven and transformed into the Bride of Christ (1 Cor. 15:42–57). The Bride is presented to her Groom “as a pure virgin,” a reference to the resurrection body (2 Cor. 11:2b; Eph. 5:27).</li>
                <li>In heaven during the Tribulation, the Bride is prepared for her triumphant return with the Groom at the Second Advent (Rev. 19:7–14). The royal family will be present to observe Operation Footstool, when all enemies are put under Christ’s feet (Heb. 1:13), and will rule with Christ during His millennial reign (1 Thess. 3:13; Rev. 5:10).</li>
                <li>After the Millennium, the royal family will be with Christ forever in the new heavens, new earth, and new Jerusalem (2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21—22).</li>

    <h2>Doctrine of the Interpretations of History</h2>
    <ol class="roman">
        <li>
            Geographical Interpretation
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The theory that topography determines or explains the course of a nation or humanity.</li>
                <li>Rivers, valleys, mountains, weather, etc., have influence on a people; e.g., the development of the Greek city-states influenced by the surrounding mountains.</li>

        <li>
            Biological Interpretation
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The attempt to explain the direction of mankind in terms of competition for food, mates, or power. Man is subject to his heredity and culture.</li>
                <li>This theory was expounded by Thomas Malthus in his “Essay on Population” (1798): If human life is too numerous for food supply, nature has three agents to restore the balance—famine, pestilence, and war.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>The Aryan-Nordic theory: superiority of race (first advanced as a serious concept in writing by the Count Joseph Arthur de Gobineau and taken to its conclusion by Adolph Hitler).</li>
                <li>The twofold fallacy of this theory: purity of race no longer exists; the theory becomes a satanic device to set up one person or people over another.</li>

            Genius Interpretation
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The rise of a super-genius to stabilize a desperate situation in an epoch of history.</li>
                <li>For example: great men such as Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, or the Apostle Paul influencing the course of world history.</li>
                <li>God raises up men of genius to stabilize a nation—Moses, Jeremiah, Daniel, even Gentile kings such as Cyrus the Great.</li>

            Morality Interpretation
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The rise or fall of nations based on their degree of virtue and morality.</li>
                <li>For example: the rise of the Jewish nation due to its laws of morality (Ten Commandments); the fall of the Canaanites resulting from degeneracy; the decline of Greece on the basis of immorality; the rise of Rome through establishment principles. (Although based on observation, this theory must be related to principles of doctrine in order to be valid.)</li>

            Economic Interpretation
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>The definition of history in terms of economics in action (propounded by Karl Marx).</li>
                <li>For example: the Trojan War explained by the Greek’s commercial control of the Dardanelles; the Crusades explained by Western attempts to capture trade routes to the East; the French Revolution explained by the rise of a middle class, which needed economic and legislative freedom for trade and enterprise. (Fallacy arises when a correct observation excludes Jesus Christ.)</li>

        <li>
            Divine Interpretation
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Divine sovereignty and omnipotence in the affairs of mankind must be recognized.</li>
                <li>While the foregoing human interpretations of history contain elements of truth based on observation, they all fall short because they are improperly applied. They ignore or reject Jesus Christ who controls history and who is the center of history; in fact, who is history.</li>
                <li>Only dispensations, or the divine interpretation of history, present the complete picture.</li>
                <li>Divine sovereignty and the free will of man coexist in God's plan for history. God's sovereign divine plan in conjunction with the free will of man determine the course of history. Neither human failure nor the satanic confusion of cosmos diabolicus will deter the completion of history in the manner that God has decreed.</li>
