# ============================================================
# FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS (USER-APPROVED)
# ============================================================

# EXPORT BUTTON PLACEMENT:
# - NO main export menu button in page headers (removed)
# - YES individual export buttons on each doctrine section heading
# - This applies to ALL pages containing doctrines

# CROSS-REFERENCE SYSTEM:
# - The cross-reference panel is a key feature (user's favorite)
# - Click on any scripture link to show related verses
# - Panel slides in from the right
# - Shows verse relationships with strength indicators
# - Must remain fully functional

# UNIVERSAL DOCTRINE ATTRIBUTES:
# - All doctrines across the entire site share common attributes
# - When styling/features are added to doctrines, they should be consistent
# - Individual doctrine export buttons are a universal attribute

# ============================================================
# DOCTRINE DEFINITION & IDENTIFICATION
# ============================================================

# WHAT IS A DOCTRINE:
# A doctrine is any standalone theological teaching or compilation of teachings.
# Doctrines exist in TWO forms:
#
# 1. LIBRARY DOCTRINES (in doctrines_library_wp_publish.html):
#    - Each <section id="..."> containing an <h2> heading is a doctrine
#    - Examples: "Doctrine of Imputation", "Doctrine of Grace", etc.
#    - These are shorter, summary-style doctrines
#
# 2. STANDALONE DOCTRINE PAGES:
#    - Full-page treatments of major doctrines
#    - Located in their own directories (doctrine-of-*)
#    - The ENTIRE PAGE is ONE doctrine, with multiple sections
#    - Examples:
#      * divine-decree_wp_publish.html = "Doctrine of the Divine Decree"
#      * divine-essence-3_wp_publish.html = "Doctrine of Divine Essence"
#    - Section headings (h2) within these are SUBSECTIONS, not separate doctrines

# KNOWN DOCTRINE PAGES:
# - Doctrines/doctrines_library_wp_publish.html (contains 36+ doctrines)
# - Doctrines/doctrine-of-the-divine-decree/divine-decree_wp_publish.html (1 doctrine)
# - Doctrines/doctrine-of-divine-essence/divine-essence-3_wp_publish.html (1 doctrine)

# EXPORT BUTTON RULES:
# - Library page: Export button on EACH doctrine section heading
# - Standalone pages: Export button on the MAIN doctrine title (h1)
# - Subsection headings (h2) on standalone pages do NOT get export buttons

# SCRIPT DETECTION PATTERNS:
# To identify doctrine pages programmatically:
# - Library: Look for <section id="..."> with <h2> children
# - Standalone: Look for directories matching "doctrine-of-*"
# - Or files matching "*doctrine*_wp_publish.html"

# ============================================================
# CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS RESOLVED
# ============================================================

# The following documentation files contain outdated references to
# "Export button (bottom right)" which referred to the OLD main export menu.
# These should be interpreted as referring to individual doctrine export
# buttons, NOT a floating main export menu:
#
# - QUICK_DEPLOY.md
# - VERSION_3.0_SUMMARY.md
# - WORDPRESS_DEPLOYMENT.md
# - WORDPRESS_FIX_DEPLOYMENT.md
# - TROUBLESHOOTING_WORDPRESS_INTERACTIVE.md
