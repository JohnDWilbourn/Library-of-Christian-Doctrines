Claude, I need to use your expertise on this Cross Reference function. It's going to be fully functional and interactive. The API Key is going to populate all the verses in the scripture index page. that allows all the verses to be stored locally to not tax the API key, to keep users from slowing down the site with clicking on verses links. get rid of the export button that's on the page next to the cross reference button. The export button and function that is at the top of every individual doctrine entry is the better way to give the user options to export as a print using system dialog, export as a .txt file, export as a PDF. I'd like for the user to be able to retain the formatting when user exports. The formatting is good. So, here's what we're doing with the cross reference function. The user can click on that button and the cross reference panel expands open. When the user clicks on a scripture with the cross reference panel open, the selected verse occupies the top entry and related verses follow as entries below the selected verse in the panel. Works perfect in Firefox on my laptop, not so much in firefox on my mobile. The panel in mobile opens to take up the whole screen and that blocks user's access to the page where the verses and the content reside. I think it will be a bettv.orger idea to devote less than half the screen space to the cross reference panel. I also want to see a method of vertically navigating these long pages. a "back to top" floating button. And I'd like to see a right-click context menu for the user to copy the verse, share the verse, go to the verse at esv.org.
